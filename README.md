# Escooter DBMS Project

The eScooter Database Management System (DBMS) project is a comprehensive solution designed to 
facilitate the management of a modern scooter rental service. In response to the increasing demand for eco
friendly urban transportation options, the project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for 
both customers and service providers. 
 
At its core, the eScooter DBMS is built upon a robust relational database schema, carefully crafted to 
accommodate the complex network of entities and relationships inherent in the scooter rental ecosystem. 
The schema encompasses tables for managing key entities such as companies offering rental services, cities 
where the service operates, renting stations scattered across urban landscapes, individual users availing the 
service, scooters available for rent, and detailed transactional records. 
 
Through the utilization of SQL technology and best practices in database design, the system offers a range 
of functionalities to enhance operational efficiency and user satisfaction. Users can effortlessly browse 
available scooters, initiate rentals, track rental history, and manage personal accounts through a user
friendly interface. Renting stations are empowered with tools to efficiently manage scooter inventory, 
handle rental transactions, and schedule maintenance tasks to ensure fleet reliability. 
 
The eScooter DBMS not only streamlines day-to-day operations but also provides valuable insights 
through comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities. Service providers can gain actionable 
intelligence on rental patterns, customer preferences, and fleet utilization, enabling data-driven decision
making to optimize resources and improve service quality. 
 
Furthermore, the project is designed with scalability and adaptability in mind, capable of accommodating 
future expansions and enhancements as the scooter rental industry continues to evolve. By providing a 
solid foundation for efficient data management and seamless interactions between stakeholders, the 
eScooter DBMS contributes to the sustainability and success of scooter rental businesses in urban 
environments, fostering environmentally conscious transportation solutions for the future.
